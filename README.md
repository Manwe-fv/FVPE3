# FVPE3

An update to E3 that allows usage on the latest Macroquest Emu builds and includes edits custom to the Firiona Vie Project server.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to classic client limitations, some E3 functionality will not work. This is due to a lack of XTargets, visibility of debuffs on mobs, etc. Check issues for a full list.
